Static site generator
=====================

This plugin generates a static snapshot of a WordPress site, and updates it
as needed. The resulting static tree can be served independently of WordPress
itself (and in fact the web server responsible doesn't need to be able to
execute PHP or CGI scripts).

The plugin was developed for and used to serve [The Space](http://thespace.org/)

This is a snapshot of the code as currently used by The Space; it's in
need of clean-up and documentation.
